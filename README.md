I'm a rising graduate of the Data Engineering Program at [Epicodus](https://www.epicodus.com/), headed by the folks at [Data Stack Academy](https://www.datastack.academy/). Here you can check out some of the projects I've been working on, using Python, SQL, DBT, Google Cloud, and BigQuery. Right now we're learning Airflow and Spark.
