### I'm a rising graduate of the Data Engineering Program at [Epicodus](https://www.epicodus.com/), headed by the fine folks at [Data Stack Academy](https://www.datastack.academy/). Prior to that I was doing data analysis in public health. In between, I was sleeping out of my car going cross-country (pictured).
